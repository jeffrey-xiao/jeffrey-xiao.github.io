    <h2>Competitive Programming</h2>
    <p>
        This repository stores all the work I've done in competitive programming.
        <br><br>
        Under the codebook package, you will find Java and C++ implementations of useful algorithms, theorems, and paradigms. If a program is describing an algorithmic paradigm (E.G. Divide and conquer),
        there is usually a reference problem to help explain the method.
        <br><br>
        Under the contest package, you will find my solutions to various problems in Java or C++.
        The solution are organized by the origin of the problem (E.G. CCC, USACO, COCI).

    <h2>WhizBridge</h2>
    <p>
        A web and iOS application that provides a buyer-oriented markerplace for tech support providers and the users who need them.
        The application uses Twilio and BrainTree in order to make payments and orders easy and convenient.
        For people who needed the service, the entire process is accountless, meaning that you do not need to disclose
        confidential information to create an account. Each order is hashed and transformed into a temporary link that expires
        once the job is canceled or completed. Each order is tagged by location and can be searched by price and job description.
        The entire process is discrete, convenient, and secure.

    <h2>Resistora</h2>
    <p>
        An Android application that allows you to determine the resistance of various resistors by aiming your camera at the resistor.
        It uses image recognition algorithms built from scratch to detemine the color of the bands.
        The location of the bands is determined by the saturation and lightness of each vertical strip when the image is converted to HSL.
        Resistora was created for Tech Retreat 2015 and won second place.

    <h2>Circle Gravity</h2>
    <p>
        A simple implementation of a two dimensional collision simulator using <code>javax.swing</code>.
        You can adjust the coefficient of resistitution, frames per second, and the acceleration of gravity.

    <h2>Single and Multiplayer Tetris</h2>
    <p>
        Java implementation of local single and multiplayer tetris. 
        Online support is coming soon.

    <h2>Genetic Programming Reversi</h2>
    <p>
        Simple application of genetic programming to create artificial intelligence that plays against humans.
        The implementation uses the synmetry of the board to weight the different grid positions.
